# Scripts
A collection of scripts that I wrote to make life easier.

## In this collection:
* save.py

### Save.py
#### How to Use
1. Run 'python save.py' in command line.
2. Type in commit message.

##### Notice
1. The script won't account for when pull fails.
2. Does the script exit when pull fails?
