# gitcmd
This script makes inputting git commands into the terminal a little more automated. For personal use really.

## How to Use
1. Run 'python gitacpp.py' in command line.
2. Type in commit message.

### Notice
1. The script won't account for when pull fails.
2. Does the script exit when pull fails?
